<h2>Additional Information about the Child Life Program</h2>
<!-- Accordion section !-->
<!-- Item 1 !-->
<h2>Preparing Children and Teens for Medical Procedures</h2>
<p><span style="color: #131313;">Surgery, blood draws, and broken bones, are a few procedures the Child Life team teaches kids about what to expect, how the body works, and decrease the fear and anxiety that come with each procedure.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #131313;">In collaboration with providing age-appropriate education for children and teens, during medical procedures they provide distraction and relaxation techniques. Additionally, they assist caregivers in helping their loved ones during medical procedures. Their goal is to make each procedure as positive as possible for patients and families.</span></p>

<!-- Item 2 !-->
<h2>Therapeutic & Medical Play</h2>
<p><span>Playing helps children cope with and adjust to their hospital experience by providing them with a safe and developmentally appropriate way to express themselves, meet their treatment goals, decrease pain, and help them feel like themselves.</span></p>

<p><span>Our Child Life team uses medical play to help teach children about procedures, diagnosis, and so much more. This gives the children and teens a hands-on learning experience so they can express their feelings or concerns.</span></p>

<!-- Item 3 !-->
<h2>Sibling & Family Support</h2>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Siblings:</span><span> A trip to the hospital can be difficult for the child and also affect siblings. They need to understand what is happening and need to work through their feelings. Our child life specialists are here to help children understand the situation and provide age-appropriate support.</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Family:</span><span> Medical treatments and hospital visits affect the entire family. Families benefit from emotional support during their child&rsquo;s hospital stay. Child life specialists help caregivers communicate with their child&rsquo;s healthcare team to promote a family-centered experience.</span></p>
