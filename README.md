<h1>&ldquo;Words Matter&rdquo; Language Guide</h1>
<h2>Call to Action</h2>
<p>At Denver Health&rsquo;s Center for Addiction Medicine (CAM), we are committed to providing the highest standard of care for people with substance use disorder (SUD). Our dedication to improving patient experiences and outcomes has led us to launch the &ldquo;Words Matter&rdquo; campaign - a transformative initiative born out of a data driven revelation.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Words Matter&rdquo; campaign came to fruition following a thorough data analysis that highlighted the presence of stigmatizing language in our patient notes and interactions. This data shed light on the specific areas where stigmatizing words were most frequently used, revealing the potential harm they can cause to individuals seeking help for SUD.</p>

<p>Fueled by the desire to foster a culture of understanding, empathy, and support, we recognized the urgent need for change. At the CAM, we are determined to make a difference at Denver Health through language transformation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h2 style="text-align: center;"><em>Promoting Clinically Accurate, Person-First Language in Addiction Medicine</em></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h2>Effect of Language on Care:</h2>
<p>Language plays a significant role in addiction medicine, shaping the experiences of people with Substance Use Disorder (SUD) and influencing their willingness to seek help. Stigmatizing language can perpetuate harmful stereotypes, hinder open communication, and create barriers to treatment. It may lead to feelings of shame, isolation, and hopelessness for those struggling with SUD, deterring them from accessing the support they need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h2>Embracing Person-First Language in Addiction Medicine:</h2>
<p>When we use person-first language, we foster a culture of understanding and empathy. By addressing individuals with SUD as people first, we acknowledge their inherent dignity and worth, promoting a sense of belonging and trust. Person-first language emphasizes that SUD is just one aspect of a person&rsquo;s life and does not define their entire identity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h2>What is Stigmatizing Language in Addiction Medicine?</h2>
To better support our patients, it&rsquo;s crucial to be aware of stigmatizing language in our
communications and interactions. Stigmatizing language refers to the use of words or phrases that devalue and label individuals based on their substance use disorder. It focuses solely on their condition, overlooking their strengths, struggles, and individuality. <p>Stigmatizing language can perpetuate harmful attitudes and prejudices, hindering progress towards recovery and well-being. Examples of stigmatizing language include phrases such as &ldquo;addict,&rdquo; &ldquo;drug abuser,&rdquo; or &ldquo;junkie.&rdquo; This language neglects the complex factors that contribute to a person&rsquo;s struggles and successes with a substance use disorder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h2>Recommended Language</h2>
<p>The following table has been developed to serve as a valuable resource for health care providers and professionals. It aims to promote a culture of understanding and empathy, facilitating improved care for people with Substance Use Disorder (SUD). The guidance within the &ldquo;<strong>Use This&hellip; Instead of This&hellip; Because&hellip;</strong>&rdquo; table has been developed through a collaborative effort, drawing upon the expertise of subject matter experts in addiction medicine. It is grounded in clinical research, patient-centered approaches, and commitment to reducing the stigma often associated with SUD. It offers alternatives to stigmatizing terms and suggests appropriate terminology to create a more supportive and
empathetic environment for people with SUD.</p>

<h2>Take the &ldquo;Words Matter&rdquo; Pledge</h2>
<p>As part of our commitment to driving change within Denver Health, we invite you to join the &ldquo;Words Matter&rdquo; pledge. By taking this pledge, you:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Understand the significance of the language you use when discussing substance
    use both in documentation and interactions.</li>
    <li>Believe that using clinically accurate and person-first language is essential in
    reducing stigma and improving care.</li>
    <li>Pledge to use language that acknowledges substance use disorder as a treatable
    medical condition, from which people can and do recover, rather than viewing it
    as a moral failing.</li>
</ul>
<p>As health care personnel, we have the power to catalyze change by moving away from terminology that negatively impacts care. Language may change over time as we better understand substance use disorder. Let&rsquo;s continually re-evaluate the words we use and professionally model clinically accurate, person-first language to stop the stigma of substance use disorder.</p>
